# Project Name: Global Happiness Analysis Report
This analysis is based on the World Happiness Report. The dataset highlighted various factors influencing the happiness score of one hundred and forty-six (146) countries, globally. These factors include GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom to make life choices, generosity, and perceptions of corruption.

# Project objective: Problem Statement
The objective of this analysis is to explore the factors contributing to the happiness levels of different countries as depicted in the World Happiness Report dataset. By examining metrics such as GDP per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom to make life choices, generosity, and perceptions of corruption, the project aims to identify patterns and correlations that influence overall happiness scores.

# Data Sourcing:
This data was scrapped from web via https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_CnjjxdWbtB5mhh2nvazMmOQMO0H-WdY/view?usp=drivesdk 
I used a google drive direct link generation to ensure the data was not missing.

# Data Cleaning and Manipulation:
To ensure accuracy and the reliability of the analysis, the data was cleaned and manipulated using the power query editor in Power BI. The Dashboard was created using Power BI desktop.
I created “new measures” with DAX for Total Countries, Happiest Country in the world and Saddest Country in the world.

# Findings
1.	KPI displayed 146 total countries, Finland as the happiest Country in the world with a happiness score of 7.82 and Afghanistan as the saddest country in the world with a happiness score of 2.40.
2.	The top 10 happy countries exhibit significantly higher happiness scores compared to others. These countries are Finland, Denmark, Iceland, Switzerland, Netherland, Luxembourg, Sweden, Norway, Israel and New Zealand.
3.	The bottom 10 sad countries have happiness scores of 3.76 and below. These countries are Afghanistan, Lebanon, Zimbabwe, Rwanda, Botswana, Lesotho, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, Malawi and Zambia.
4.	The average global happiness score is 5.55, indicating a moderate level of overall happiness across the world.
5.	There is a positive correlation between happiness score and healthy life expectancy, indicating that countries with higher life expectancy tend to have higher happiness scores.
6.	Countries with higher levels of social support tend to have higher happiness scores.
7.	Positive correlation observed between happiness score and GDP, suggesting that rich countries tend to have higher happiness scores.
8.	Countries above the happiness average enjoy freedom, while those below also have significant freedom. This shows that human rights are in play in most countries of the world.
9.	Most countries exhibit low corruption perception rates, with selected high happiness countries showing higher corruption perceptions. Therefore, corruption is not a major determinant for happiness globally.
10.	Majority of countries fall within a narrow range of generosity, with few outliers where generosity rates are high but happiness scores are below average. This proves that generosity is not a major determinant for happiness in the world.

# Recommendations:
To improve global happiness scores, it is important to implement policies focusing on healthcare, social support, economic development, and governance. Investments in healthcare systems, social welfare programs, and community engagement initiatives can improve both life expectancy and overall well-being. Also, ensuring personal freedom and combating corruption, are essential for fostering happiness and trust within societies. These are necessary to creating a happier world for all.
